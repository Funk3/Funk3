# Hi, I'm Zak ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸš€ About me 

ðŸ’»  Currently working on an "I'm Board", a MERN app (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) that is Padmapper for board games! Use a map to find where you can play your games, and use the calendar to know when! 

âš¡  If I am not coding, I am riding my bike training for this year's Gran Fondo, or working on learning something new on my home server!
